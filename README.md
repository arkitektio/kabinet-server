# Port-Server

## Develompent

Port is a GraphQL API that allows you to spawn containers on a connected container backend. It is designed to be
used with Arkitekt Apps that are running in these containers, but can be used for any containerized application.

It is aimed at being a simple way to spawn containers on a backend, and to allow users to connect to these containers
as such it aims to provides a few backends:

-   Docker: Spawn containers on a docker host 

-   Kubernetes: Spawn containers on a Kubernetes cluster (not yet implemented)
